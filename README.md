Arduino Sketches:
Attached Sketch to use Arduino UNO as a multivolt meter with LDR light sensor.

R,G,B led used for different conditions.


DC Volt Meter with 3 x Led           
RED GREEN BLUE LED's                 

For Wind Turbine / Solar Monitoring  

Send data to Serial also serial data gets added to a web page 
locally on MAC via USB connection usb - Serial -> web allows remote view the voltage outputs      
                                     
Will add more voltage monitors       
Will add arduino ethernet sheild     
put unit in enclosure and can be placed in Solar cage                 
                                
Relay will be added to trigger when Light lever drops - LDR         
Using lightwaveRF unit to switch over from mains to solar - after charging
