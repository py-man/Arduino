Arduino
=======

Arduino Sketches:
Attached Sketch uses Arduino Mega as a multivolt / AMP  meter with LDR light sensor with remote control / IP and LCD display.

Ethernet shield used for connectivity and remote control
LCD added for visual graph / view of volatge
Relay Shield used to control Power sockets and Lights

For Wind Turbine / Solar Monitoring  
                                     
Will add more voltage monitors / amp monitors, plus pressure and Temp       
Using lightwaveRF unit to switch over from mains to solar - after charging                     


--Added ethernet shield for remote monitoring and connectivity

--Added relay shield for device / plug / socket control based on remote trigger or voltage levels

--Attached picture of working unit

--Need to attach circut diagram
