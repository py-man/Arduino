#[arduino-network-voltmeter]

    For Wind Turbine / Solar Monitoring & Automatic Transfer Switch

    Attached Sketch uses Arduino Mega as a multivolt / AMP  meter with LDR light sensor with remote control / IP and LCD display.

     Ethernet shield used for connectivity and remote control
 
     LCD added for visual graph / view of volatge
 
     Relay Shield used to control Power sockets and Lights
                                     
     Will add more voltage monitors / amp monitors, plus pressure and Temp       
     
     Using lightwaveRF unit to switch over from mains to solar - after charging                     

#[Updated]
 
     --Added ethernet shield for remote monitoring and connectivity

     --Added relay shield for device / plug / socket control based on remote trigger or voltage levels

     --Attached picture of working unit

     --Need to attach circut diagram

#[auruino-pressure-ultrasound-compass]

Used to show how to detect motion, show distance via ultrasound and give pressure and Temp Readings.

This is the start of a Network enabled weather station.

     --Added Wireless Network Sheild to remotely Monitor
     --Added Compass & BMP modules
